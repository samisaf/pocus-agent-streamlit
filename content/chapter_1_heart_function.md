Ejection Fraction
How-to
Visual assessment of all 4 windows, will get a good sense from the PLA.
Look for thickening of LV walls during systole and not just the swinging motion of heart.
Also look for longitudinal movement of mitral annulus in the A4C view.
Estimate the percent (%) ejected with each heart beat.
Slow the video down and look at the LV at end diastole and end systole; at its largest and at its smallest cavity size.
Mentally trace the inside of the LV at end diastole and end systole.
Not as hard as it seems, and more reproducible the most measurements.
Interpretation
EF > 70% → Hyperdynamic: Excellent function, complete ejection, LV empty at end systole

EF 55-70% → Normal: Good function, most blood is ejected, some blood remains at end systole

EF <55, >40% → Mild LV dysfunction: Decreased function, <55% of blood is ejected, blood remains at end systole

EF <40, >30% → Moderate dysfunction: Very dysfunctional, little blood is ejected, blood remains at end systole

EF <30% → Severe dysfunction: Barely moving, almost no blood is ejected, full at end systole

Tips
Do not overthink; it will become intuitive quickly.

Think of it is as: Excellent, Good, not as good as I want, poor, and shockingly bad.

Foreshortening of ventricles will result in overestimation of EF.

Heart rate effect may make EF falsely look better (w/ tachycardia) or worse (w/ bradycardia) in some patients.

Most errors occur between mildly dysfunctional and lower end of normal.

Do not worry too much about this difference, ICU patients should have a high EF. Low end of normal and mildly dysfunctional are both problematic.

Make sure to use cardiac exam or presets. If using abdominal imaging the heart will look dysfunctional.

Stroke Volume
Stroke volume is calculated from two measurements: Left ventricular outflow tract diameter (LVOTd):

Measured from the PLA in mid- systole, with active zoom if available.
Measured from inner edge to inner edge before the bump of leaflet insertion on LV side.
Normal 1.8-2.2 cm.
Left ventricular outflow tract velocity time integral (LVOT VTI):

Measured from the AP 5.
Place the pulsed wave doppler cursor just before the AV leaflets.
Trace the envelope of flow, make sure to start and end at the baseline, from when the valve opens til it closes.
Normal 16-35 cm.
Interpretation
Calculated using the following formula: SV = π x (LVOTd/2)2 x LVOTVTI

Tips
LVOTd
Look closely at the aortic valve for stenosis.
Related to BSA smaller people <1.8 cm and larger >2.2 cm.
Anatomic fact does not change rapidly in an adult, so only needs to be measured once in an adult.
LVOT VTI Cursor placement
Measured from the AP 5.
Do not count if angle > 15% from midline.
Do not count if passes through septum.
VTI waveform
Select largest envelope if heart beat regular or average of 3-5 beats if irregular.
Velocity can be underestimated with aliasing.
LVOT VTI is not a reliable tool in the presence of aortic valve stenosis.

E-Point Septal Separation
How-to
Obtain a PLAX view with visualization of the mitral valve leaflets and interventricular septum.

Select M-mode and place the cursor at the tip of the anterior mitral valve leaflet.

Measure the distance from the interventricular septum to the point of maximal excursion of the anterior mitral valve leaflet (E-wave) on the m-mode tracing.

Interpretation
Normal: <7mm

Mild/Moderate LV Dysfunction (EF 30- 50%): 7-13mm

Severe LV dysfunction (EF <30%): >13mm

Tips
The more horizontal the ventricles lie in PLAX the more accurate the measurement.

Place the M-mode cursor as close to the tip of the mitral valve leaflet as possible.

Pitfalls
Measurement not accurate in patients who have pathology of the mitral valve or moderate to severe aortic regurgitation.

Patients with severely thickened interventricular septum such as in LVH or HOCM can have an overestimation of LV function.

Right Ventricle
How-to
Visual assessment of all 4 windows, but the short axis and apical 4-most important

Assessment of the IVC and IJs additive information
If RV dysfunctional may indicate volume overload
Ventilator can cause same effect with normal RV function
Short axis
Septal flattening and D-shaped LV
Enlarged RV
Best seen at the papillary level
Apical 4
Enlargement of the RV relative to the LV
The RV should be 1/3 the LV
Maybe closer to equal in intubated patients
Anterior motion of the RV at the tricuspid valve
Basis of TAPSE, but can be assessed visually
Interpretation
Graded as normal function or mild, moderate and severe dysfunction

Tips
Do not overthink; it will become intuitive quickly

Think of it is as: Fine, not great and terrible

Make sure to use cardiac exam or presets. If using abdominal imaging the heart will look dysfunctional

If the RV is foreshortened (looks more like a softball then a football) it may look dysfunctional when function is normal

TAPSE
How-to
TAPSE measures the longitudinal movement of the lateral tricuspid annular plane during systole.

In the apical 4 view, align the cursor on the lateral tricuspid annulus.

Using M-Mode measure the peak distance of the tricuspid annulus from end-diastole to the end of systole.

Interpretation
TAPSE less than 17 mm suggests decreased RV systolic function.

Tips
Do not use TAPSE with poor 2D visualization of right heart as M-Mode relays on good 2D images.

Using appropriate gain can decrease noise artifact.

It is very important to align the cursor properly with the annular longitudinal excursion as TAPSE is angle dependent.

Compare at least 5 cardiac cycles for the most accurate measurement.

Make sure to use cardiac exam or presets. If using abdominal imaging the heart will look dysfunctional.
